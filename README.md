# Startup-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Machine learning algorithm is used to find the startup prediction to invest 

Libraries used - Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas

Non numerical values are converted into numerical datas using fit transform method

dataset is divided into training set and test set with the percentage of 80% and 20% respectively

the trained dataset can be saved and can be stored in any devices to predict the higher profit startup for the future
